superiority of D-Grid compare to vanilla
========================================

On this graph we can clearly see that the path realised with the vanilla simulation will converge with the other four present trajectories, there is a conflict point at [0,0]. The Vanilla simulation does not know how to react and will tend to accelerate in an attempt to anticipate the trajectories coming from the northwest quadrant of the graph. This will make the situation worse as there is a higher speed and it can only react less well to the change of trajectory such as the one made by the trajectory starting at the point [-4,1]. In contrast to this, the D-Grid simulation opted for a more wait-and-see solution and slightly decreased the speed that was initially planned for the person being steered, thus allowing observation of the behaviour of other people on the graph. Thus we can take a step back and avoid the conflict situation. This behaviour is therefore more appropriate to a situation of convergence of trajectories.

This situation is reminiscent of the convergence situation discussed earlier in this case we observe that the Vanilla simulation converges again with the other trajectories. Contrary to this, the D-Grid simulation will deviate from the point of convergence by anticipating the trajectory coming from the point [3,0.5] as rectilinear and will therefore pass behind this user. Thanks to this anticipation we avoid the conflict zone present in the centre of the graph at the end of the experiment.

This last image is the most representative It first demonstrates that the Vanillas strategy leads to a conflict zone because if we follow the trajectory it dictates we will collide with the trajectory from the point [-3.5,-1] which should never happen. The D-Grid strategy has the ability to follow the trajectory initially planned by the guided person. In our case it is also an optimal trajectory, as it avoids the accident generated by the vanilla strategy by taking the lead.
